# Source code of DCAT (Differentiable Clustering for Graph Attention. TKDE 2024)

This repository contains the source code (branch `main`) of the paper "Differentiable Clustering for Graph Attention" published in TKDE 2024. This branch contains my original code for the experiments. The packages and their versions are listed in `requirements.txt`. The reorganized code is in the branch `simple`, which adapts to more recent packages, has simpler APIs and is easier to use.

You can unzip the dataset in `data` directory. And run the code with the following command:
```
python tune/wiki.py
```
under the `src` directory.
